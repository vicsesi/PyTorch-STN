## Description

Spatial transformer networks are a generalization of differentiable attention to any spatial transformation. Spatial transformer networks (STN for short) allow a neural network to learn how to perform spatial transformations on the input image in order to enhance the geometric invariance of the model. For example, it can crop a region of interest, scale and correct the orientation of an image. It can be a useful mechanism because CNNs are not invariant to rotation and scale and more general affine transformations. 

Goals of the project:

- Investigate if using CoordConv layers instead of standard Conv will help to improve the performance.
- Compare the performance of the new model in evaluation metric and motivate the choice of metrics.
